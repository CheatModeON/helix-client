# Helix; Voice-enabled JavaScript game made with p5.js

This is a little game I made during COVID-19 outbreak. The motivation was to create a game in p5.js, understand the physics of a 2D game in JavaScript and make it interactive using the microphone of the device.
Furthermore, I coded a server in Node.js that runs on Heroku ([code here](https://github.com/CheatModeON/helix-server)) that allows multiplayer game in a fashion of viewing other players as ghosts.

# How to play

To play the game visit this [link](https://cheatmodeon.github.io/helix-client/).
If prompt by the browser, allow to use microphone access and click once to start the game.
Use your voice to control Helix and try to avoid comets while staying inside the game's limits.
